			<p>If each of us can learn to relate to each other more out of compassion, with a sense of connection to each other and a deep recognition of our common humanity, and more important, to teach this to our children, I believe that this can go a long way in reducing many of the conflicts and problems that we see today. Let us cultivate love and compassion, both of which give life true meaning. This is the religion I preach. It is simple. Its temple is the heart. Its teaching is love and compassion. Its moral values are "loving and respecting others" whoever they may be. Whether one is a lay person or a monastic, we have no other option if we wish to survive in this world.<sup>3</sup></p>
			<p>Whether we like it or not, we have all been born on this earth as part of one great human family. Rich or poor, educated or uneducated, belonging to one nation or another, to one religion or another, adhering to this ideology or that, ultimately each of us is just a human being like everyone else: we all desire happiness and do not want suffering. Furthermore, each of us has an equal right to pursue these goals.<sup>4</sup> In daily practice, reflect on the benefits of love, compassion and kindness, then reflect on the disadvantages of anger. Such continuous contemplation, the growing appreciation of love, has the effect of reducing our inclination towards hatred and increasing our respect for love. By this means even anger can be diminished.<sup>5</sup> Every one of us is getting older, which is a natural process. Time is constantly moving on, second by second. Nothing can stop it, but what we can do is use our time properly; that is in our hands.</p>

					<h5>Giandomenico painted other colorful sketches of Venetian life during Carnival. The Minuet, painted just three years earlier, includes a mondo nuovo, visible in the far left corner. A barker, seemingly lurking in the shadows, surveys the festive crowd. This is the first time the device appears in Giandomenico&#39;s work, albeit as a somewhat marginal reference in a Carnival scene.</h5>
